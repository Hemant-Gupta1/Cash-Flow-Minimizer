# Features:
This Python programme simulates a simplified debt settlement system for a group of individuals who 
conduct transactions with one another. Participants are represented as instances of the "Participant" class, 
which stores information such as their name, payment modalities, and total transaction amount. 
The main function, "settleDebts," computes and displays the transactions required to efficiently settle 
debts among participants. To limit the overall number of transactions, it employs numerous payment ways and 
a central participant with all payment modalities. The programme accepts user input for the number of participants,
their details, and transaction information, and then displays a clear picture of how participants settle 
their debts through a series of calculated transactions. The code makes use of functions to handle various 
components of the debt settlement process, which improves readability and modularization.
